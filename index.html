              <h3>Gameplay</h3>
              <p>
                Each player reveals the top card of their stack simultaneously.
              </p>
              <p>
                The player with the highest card wins the round and collects the
                point.
              </p>
              <p>
                In case of a tie (war), each tied player places an additional
                card. The player with the highest card wins 4 points. If there's
                another tie, the process repeats until there's a clear winner.
