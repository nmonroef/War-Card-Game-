        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>GamePlay</h3>
            <p>
              Each player reveals the top card of their stack simultaneously.
            </p>
            <p>
              The player with the highest card wins the round and collects the
              point
            </p>
            <p>
              In case of a tie (war), each tied player places three additional
              cards face down and then reveals the fourth card. The player with
              the highest fourth card wins all the cards on the table. If
              there's another tie, the process repeats until there's a clear
              winner.
